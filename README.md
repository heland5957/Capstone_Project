For my project for this course, I decided to improve upon a Web Application that I have created in previous class but only has the main functions. In this class, my project will be to improve the application in terms of adding more features, more security measures and adding the ability to distribute the app in a form of web application, local software or mobile apps. For the moment, the app exist in my GitHub page through this link, and it is primarily a task tracker with a user assignment feature and all the functionality for each task. Here is a screen capture of what the web application is hosted on GitHub with the main functions active:

This is only a sample of what I could do during the course period but I wanted to improve with some features but I was limited in time. I wanted to improve upon the graphical tracking as well as it does not look satisfying at this time

----Language----
Javascript will be the preferred language for this application and I will keep using Javascript for implementing the additional features. I have done a bit of research and I saw that using Node.js to use the database will be necessary

----Host----
Currently, the app is hosted through GitHub pages which is basically online. I will keep that feature or have a combination of online host and server host depending on how heavy the application is.

-----Database Management---
Database management will be a comnination of SQLite and Node.JS mainly to keep track of the tasks and the user assigned to.

-----Security Measures---
I will add security measures that will allow adding tasks, adding users, use the functions of the tasks based on authorized users. The users will be likely stored in the database and only the admin will be able to have full control of the application

----Delivery Method---
Each week, I will update on the progress of the application based on what was accomplished and what is expected to be accomplished. My goal for this course is to deliver a full fledged application that even I can use on my own devices. At first, I thought a mobile application will be feasible but I would focus more on productivity for business, rather than a casual.
